    //(4, 5, 6) because 4 is 75% of the way between 1 and 5;5 if 75% of the way between 2 and 6 and 6 is 75% of the way between 3 and 7

    Color.Lerp and Vector.Lerp these work in the same way as Mathf.Lerp
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Mathf.Lerp takes 3 float parameters each representing there interpolate and gives them their value

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        light.intensity = Mathf.Lerp(light.intensity, 8f, 0.5f);
        light.intensity = Mathf.Lerp(light.intensity, 8f, 00.5f * Time.deltaTime);
    }
    //This would mean the change to intensity would happen per second instead of per frame
